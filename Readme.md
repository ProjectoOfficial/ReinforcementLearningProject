# Reinforcement Learning Project
This project is an integral part of the material to take the Reinforcement Learning exam (9 CFU) of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.

### Devel Branch Instruction
the devel branch, as you can guess from the name, is the branch used to develop the code. Once satisfied with the version of the code obtained, it is possible to make a pull request against the branch master.

To start working it is necessary to follow the following steps:

1. if you don't already have one, create a workspace:
    ```
    mkdir ~/developments
    cd ~/developments
    ```
2. clone the repository from github:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/ReinforcementLearningProject.git
    cd ReinforcementLearningProject
    ```
3. move to _devel_ branch:
    ```
    git checkout -b devel
    git fetch
    git pull
    ```
